## 1. Discuss the advantages and limits of different wheel drives

### Differential Drive

**Advantages** 

Simplicity. Differential drive system is very sample, and the wheels in the most of the time is directly connected to the moter.

**Limits**

Very hard to control. Itâ€™s very difficult for differential drive robot to keep straight, because each wheel is separately controlled. And if the speed of each wheel is not precisely equal,

### Ackerman Drive

**Advantages**

Easy to simulate, and the geometry is simple.Effectively stop the slippage of front wheels. The area of the required facility is limited, so it can be done in small area.

**Limits**
This kind of drive requires a non-holonomic plan.

### Synchonous Drive

**Advantages**

It's easier to control all the wheels because the motors are separately translationed and rotationed. And it's also easy to drive straight because the motion is mechanlially.

**Limits**

The machine itself is very difficult to design and implement because of the limited manifactory.

### XR4000 Drive

**Advantages**

This kind of drive is similiar to synchonous drive, actually is a basic type of the above ones. So the advantages are highly likely to synchonous drive.

**Limits**

Just like synchonous drive: difficult to design and implement.

### Mecanum Drive

**Advantages**

Mecanum drive can be moved in any direction while still retaining original direction and has more traction than normal wheels. Easy to program.

**Limits**

Whole structure is very expensive to use and make.

## 2. Simulate the kinematics of a robot with a differential drive

```python

vl, vr, l, x, y, angle= x1, x2, x3, 0, 0, 0
pathx, pathy = [], []

def drive(self, t=0.5):
    w = (self.vr - self.vl) / self.l
    R = self.l / 2 * (self.vl + self.vr) / (self.vr - self.vl)

    a = np.mat([[np.cos(w * t), -np.sin(w * t), 0],
                [np.sin(w * t), np.cos(w * t), 0],
                [0, 0, 1]])
    b = np.mat([[R * np.sin(self.angle)], 
    [-R * np.cos(self.angle)], [self.angle]])
    c = np.mat([[self.x - R * np.sin(self.angle)], 
    [self.y + R * np.cos(self.angle)], [w * t]])
    new = np.dot(a, b) + c
    self.x = new[0, 0]
    self.y = new[1, 0]
    self.angle = new[2, 0]
    self.pathx.append(self.x)
    self.pathy.append(self.y)

```

## 3. Simulate the motion control of a robot with a differential drive and show the resulting paths w.r.t. different control laws

```matlab
path = [4.00    4.00;
    2.00,2.00];
robotCurrentLocation = path(1,:);
robotGoal = path(end,:);
initialOrientation = 0;
robotCurrentPose = [robotCurrentLocation initialOrientation];
robotRadius = 0.4;
robot = ExampleHelperRobotSimulator('emptyMap',2);
robot.enableLaser(false);
robot.setRobotSize(robotRadius);
robot.showTrajectory(true);
robot.setRobotPose(robotCurrentPose);
plot(path(:,1), path(:,2),'k--d')
xlim([0 5])
ylim([0 5])
controller = robotics.PurePursuit;
controller.Waypoints = path;
controller.DesiredLinearVelocity = 0.3;
controller.MaxAngularVelocity = 0.3;
controller.LookaheadDistance = 0.5;
goalRadius = 1;
distanceToGoal = norm(robotCurrentLocation - robotGoal);
controlRate = robotics.Rate(10);
while( distanceToGoal > goalRadius )
    [v, omega] = controller(robot.getRobotPose);
    drive(robot, v, omega);
    robotCurrentPose = robot.getRobotPose;
    distanceToGoal = norm(robotCurrentPose(1:2) - robotGoal);
    waitfor(controlRate);
end
```
